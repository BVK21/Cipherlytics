## Introduction

Cipherlytics is a B2B SaaS platform that enables data analysts to perform real-time or batch analytics on sensitive, encrypted data. Using cutting-edge encryption technologies, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation, Cipherlytics ensures that data privacy is preserved throughout the entire analytics process.

The platform allows businesses to submit encrypted data while enabling analysts with access to build custom analytics modules, generate insights, and visualize data directly on the Cipherlytics platform.

## Features
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Perform analytics on encrypted data using homomorphic encryption, ensuring privacy.
- **Custom Module Creation**: Analysts can build and deploy custom analytics modules tailored to their use cases.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Strict access controls to ensure only authorized analysts can access sensitive data.
- **Multi-Format Data Support**: Accepts data submissions in JSON, CSV, and Excel formats.
- **Dashboard for Insights**: Analysts access an interactive dashboard for real-time insights and data visualization.
- **Encryption Support**: Clients can use Cipherlytics’ API to encrypt data using a public key before submission.
- **Secure Storage**: Data is stored in an encrypted format in a secure database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of several key components:
- **RESTEasy API**: Handles data ingestion, module management, and analytics requests.
- **Encryption Service**: Provides public keys for data encryption and decrypts data in a secure environment for processing.
- **Custom Analytics Modules**: Allows analysts to create custom modules using a plugin architecture to process encrypted data.
- **Data Processing & Analytics Engine**: Decrypts data in a secure environment and performs analytics using predefined and custom modules.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Encrypted data is securely stored in MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
- **Insights Dashboard**: Provides real-time data visualization and insights for analysts with platform access.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Uses Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring, logging, and alerting.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Manages user access and permissions for secure data handling.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language
- **RESTEasy**: API framework for handling data ingestion and analytics requests
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Using libraries such as HElib or JPaillier for encrypted computations
- **MongoDB / PostgreSQL**: Secure data storage solutions
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting
- **RabbitMQ** (optional): For queuing and asynchronous processing of large datasets

## Installation (To Be Decided)

The installation steps and prerequisites will be finalized once the project reaches its initial implementation phase. A detailed guide will be provided to help users set up the platform locally or using Docker.

### Planned Prerequisites
- **Java JDK 11 or higher**
- **Gradle**: For managing dependencies and building the project
- **Docker**: For containerization (optional)
- **MongoDB / PostgreSQL**: For local data storage setup
- **RabbitMQ**: For queuing large dataset processing (optional)

## Project Structure (To Be Decided)

The project structure will be defined as the project evolves. Below is the tentative layout of the project directories.

## Roadmap (To Be Decided)

The roadmap will be further defined as the project requirements are solidified. Below is an outline of the intended project phases.

### Phase 1: Basic Platform Setup
- Set up RESTEasy API for data submission and encryption services.
- Implement data encryption and secure storage (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).
- Create a basic analyst dashboard for accessing the platform.

### Phase 2: Custom Module System
- Define the module interface for custom analytics.
- Implement a module loading and execution system.
- Allow analysts to create and deploy custom modules.

### Phase 3: Dashboard for Insights
- Develop a web-based dashboard for real-time insights and visualizations.
- Integrate data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js).
- Implement filtering and interaction tools for analysts.

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics
- Integrate homomorphic encryption for computations on encrypted data.
- Implement clustering and other complex analytics with privacy-preserving techniques.
- Introduce differential privacy to enhance data security.

### Phase 5: Access Control & Multi-Tenancy
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for analysts.
- Introduce multi-tenant support for the SaaS model.
- Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting using Prometheus and Grafana.
