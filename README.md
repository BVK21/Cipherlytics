## Introduction

Cipherlytics is designed to perform privacy-preserving data analytics. It uses cutting-edge encryption technologies, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation, to enable businesses to compute on encrypted data, ensuring that privacy is maintained throughout the process.

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of:
- **RESTEasy API**: Handles data ingestion and analytics requests.
- **Homomorphic Encryption Library**: Processes encrypted data without decryption.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Encrypted data is stored securely in PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and logging.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language
- **RESTEasy**: API framework
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: HElib or JPaillier for encryption
- **PostgreSQL or MongoDB**: Encrypted data storage
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java JDK 11 or higher**
- **Gradle**: For managing dependencies and building the project
- **Docker**: For containerization (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cipherlytics.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Cipherlytics
Run the Gradle build:
bash
Copy code
./gradlew build
Running the Application
To run the application locally, you need a servlet container like Tomcat or WildFly.
Deploy the generated .war file to the servlet container.
Access the API at http://localhost:8080/api/.
Project Structure
The following is the high-level structure of the project:

/api: Contains all API-related code, including resource classes and service logic.
/encryption: Encryption and decryption logic, including homomorphic encryption.
/storage: Database interactions, models, and repository classes for encrypted data.
/docs: Project documentation.
Roadmap
This is the initial plan and will evolve as the project progresses:

 Set up the basic RESTEasy API using Gradle
 Integrate homomorphic encryption (JPaillier/HElib)
 Add data storage using PostgreSQL/MongoDB
 Implement secure multi-party computation (optional)
 Add real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
 Build Docker containers for easy deployment
