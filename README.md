## Introduction

Cipherlytics is designed to perform privacy-preserving data analytics. It uses cutting-edge encryption technologies, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation, to enable businesses to compute on encrypted data, ensuring that privacy is maintained throughout the process.

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of:
- **RESTEasy API**: Handles data ingestion and analytics requests.
- **Homomorphic Encryption Library**: Processes encrypted data without decryption.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Encrypted data is stored securely in PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and logging.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language
- **RESTEasy**: API framework
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: HElib or JPaillier for encryption
- **PostgreSQL or MongoDB**: Encrypted data storage
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java JDK 11 or higher**
- **Gradle**: For managing dependencies and building the project
- **Docker**: For containerization (optional)
